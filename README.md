Debugging, essentially, is a process of inspection. In such a process, developers inspect source code or execution steps to see whether the implementation deviates from their intended specification in mind. However, such manual inspection process usually requires lots of time and effort. In this paper, we presents Microbat, a feedback-based debugger which aims to locate bug by interactively recommending suspicious program steps with developers' feedback. Given a buggy program, Microbat records its execution trace and allow developers to make light-weight feedback on trace steps, such as correct step, wrong variable value, wrong path, and unclear. Microbat regards the feedback as partial program specification in developers' mind. It reasons and analyzes the feedback along with program information to recommend a suspicious step for further inspection and feedback. Such a debugging process continues until the bug is found.
